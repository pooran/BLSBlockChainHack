# BLSBlockChainHack
As part of the BLS Blockchain Hack, conceptualized idea based on requirement from Rayen Salud

Users can upload the prescription and request for bids from nearby pharmacies for a competitive price
Pharmacies bid with a price quote
User chooses a best quote either by distance or price or medicine
User applies insurance discounts
User pays for the accepted bid, and gets a code
User goes to pharmacy to pick up the medicine
Pharmacy asks for a code to validate the purchase and completes the transaction
